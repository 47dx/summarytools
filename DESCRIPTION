Title: Dataframe Summaries, Frequency Tables and Numerical Summaries with Customizable Output

Description: Includes 4 summarizing functions; two are to be used with uni-dimensional data, and the two others with dataframes. For uni-dimensional data, 'unistats' will generate common central tendency statistics and measures of dispersion for numerical data and 'frequencies' will generate a table of frequencies with counts and percentages (including cumulative). Both functions report number and proportion of valid values vs NA values. For dataframes, 'dfSummary' will generate a table containing as many rows as there are columns in the dataframe, each row giving variable information (class and type), labels if any, common statistics for numerical data and frequency tables for any type of data, along with number and proportion of valid (non-missing) values. Finally, 'properties' will conveniently report attributes of a dataframe object itself and also of all its individual components (columns).
