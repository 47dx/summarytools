Title: Detailed Dataframe Summaries, Frequency Tables, Cross-Tabulations and Descriptive Stats in plain ascii, 'rmarkdown' or HTML
Version: 0.6.9
Date: 2016-12-18
Author: Dominic Comtois
Maintainer: Dominic Comtois <dominic.comtois@gmail.com>
Description: Four main functions: 1) freq() generates frequency tables reporting counts and
    proportions (including cumulative); 2) descr() gives all common central tendency statistics and 
    measures of dispersion for numerical data; 3) ctable() generates cross-tabulations between two
    categorical variables; 4) dfSummary() gives as much information as possible about a dataframe's 
    date in a legible table. freq() and descr() support weights, and all three functions support 
    variable labels ('Hmisc' or 'pander'). Plain ascii, 'rmarkdown' and HTML outputs are available.
    An additional misc function, what.is(), displays all common properties of an object
    (its class, type, mode, attributes, etc.) and extends the base is() function, 
    checking the object against most is.() functions.
