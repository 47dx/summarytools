Tips for a smooth transition from summarytools 0.8 to 0.9
---------------------------------------------------------

Although many changes were implemented since the last CRAN version of
summarytools, all legacy code is still supported. However, some messages
will appear, signaling ongoing changes and setting the table for one
minor backward-compatibility break:

    'headings' will replace 'omit.headings': the 'omit.headings' parameter, 
    common to most summarytools functions, has been replaced by the more 
    straighforward 'headings', which is still boolean and serves the exact same
    purpose. Simply put, headings = !omit.headings. For now, 'omit.headings' 
    is still supported, but a message will be displayed in the console whenever
    it is used, encouraging users make the transition.
    
Also, to simplify printing summarytools object in the console and in Rmarkdown
documents, there are three important recommendations to follow:

1. Use stby() -- or byst() -- instead of by() with summarytools. This makes
   obsolete the use of the following idiom:
   
    > by_object <- by(data, indices, summarytools_function)
    > view(by_object, method = "pander")
    
   Rather, this single operation will accomplish the same thing:
   
    > byst(data, indices, summarytools_function)
    
2. Do not use lapply() with freq(); simply pass your dataframe - subsetted if
   needed - to freq(). That way, the printing of the output won't need to rest
   on view() and will be totally seemless.
   
3. Read the two vignettes. They will show you how to use summarytools in the
   most effective way.
