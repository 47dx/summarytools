Version 0.3
-----------
Another round of major changes.

  - Bringing in html table built with htmltools and viewable in RStudio's Viewer
  - "print.st.output" function is now used for displaying the results;
  - argument "echo" is deprecated; either display with pander or use as.table().Otherwise use view()
  - Returned objects are now of class "st.output" and have the following attributes to inform print.st.output
	* st.type : one of "freq", "desc" and "dfSummary"
	* date.time : date & time at which the function was called
	* var.name : for 'freq', and also 'desc' when a single vector is used.
	* var.label : same conditions as var.name
	* pander.args : arguments such as 'style', 'justify', 'plain.ascii', 'split.table'
  - print function has 2 possible methods: "pander", "plain", or "viewer" which uses RStudio's viewer pane
    to display an html version of the output, using bootstrap's css (getbootstrap.com)



Version 0.2
-----------
Several major changes since version 0.1

  - 'unistats' is now called 'desc'.
  - 'frequencies' is now called 'freq'.
  - 'properties' is now called 'prop'.
  - shortcuts have been added to keep backward-compatibility.
  - 'desc' now accepts dataframes as first argument; factors and character columns will be ignored.
  - 'desc' can be transposed to suit one's preferences.
  - 'freq' just returns a matrix-table, not a list anymore.
  - in 'desc' and 'freq', no more argument 'display.label'. Those are displayed automatically when present.
  - rapportools is used instead of Hmisc for variable labels
  - function 'properties' was removed for now. Maybe reintegrated in a future update.
