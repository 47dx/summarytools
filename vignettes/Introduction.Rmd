**summarytools** provides tools to *neatly and quickly summarize data*.  It 
can also make _R_ a little easier to learn and use, especially for data
cleaning and preliminary analysis. Four functions are at the core of the
package:

  - `freq()` : **frequency tables** with proportions, cumulative
    proportions and missing data information
  - `ctable()` : **cross-tabulations** between two factors or any
    discrete data, with total, rows or columns proportions, as well
    as marginal totals
  - `descr()` : **descriptive (univariate) statistics** for numerical data
  - `dfSummary()` : Extensive **data frame summaries** that facilitate
    data cleaning and firsthand evaluation

An emphasis has been put on both _what_ and _how_ results are presented, so that
the package can serve both as an exploration _and_ reporting tool, used on its 
own for minimal reports, or with other sets of tools such as 
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/).

**Building on the strengths of [pander](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) and
[htmltools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)**, the 
outputs produced by **summarytools** can be:

  - Displayed in plain text in the *R* console (default behaviour)
  - Used in *Rmarkdown* documents and *knitted* along with other text and
    *R* output
  - Written to _html_ files that fire up in
    [*RStudio*](https://www.rstudio.com/)’s Viewer pane or in the default
    browser
  - Written to plain or *Rmarkdown* text files

It is also possible to include **summarytools**' functions in *Shiny apps*. 
Notably, [radiant](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=radiant),
a Shiny-based package for business analytics, uses `dfSummary()` to describe
imported data frames.

### Latest Improvements

Version 0.9 brings **many** changes and improvements. This
[vignette](library/summarytools/doc/Changes-Introduced-in-Version-0-9.html) 
gives a detailed description of those changes, but a summary can also be found 
[at the end of this vignette](#changes).
<br/><br/>

# The Four Core Functions
## 1 - freq() : Frequency Tables

The `freq()` function generates a table of frequencies with counts and
proportions. Since this vignette was created using _Rmarkdown_, we've set the
`style` argument to “rmarkdown”; **knitr** takes care of
converting the generated markup characters into actual _html_ or _pdf_
formatting.

```{r}
library(summarytools)
freq(iris$Species, style = "rmarkdown")
```

If we do not worry about missing data, we can set `report.nas = FALSE`:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown", headings = FALSE)
```

We can simplify the results further and omit the _Totals_ row by specifying 
`totals = FALSE`.

To get familiar with the various output styles, try different values for 
`style` -- “simple”, “rmarkdown” or “grid”, and see how this affects the
results in the console.

## 2 - ctable() : Cross-Tabulations

We’ll now use a sample data frame called *tobacco*, which is included in 
**summarytools**. We want to cross-tabulate two categorical variables:
`smoker` and `diseased`.

Since *markdown* does not support multiline headings, we’ll show a 
rendered _html_ version of the results:

```{r}
print(ctable(tobacco$smoker, tobacco$diseased, prop = "r"), method = "render")
```

Note that we have to set the **knitr** chunk option `results` to “asis”
for the results to appear as they should.

By default, `ctable()` shows row proportions.
To show column or total proportions, use `prop = "c"` or `prop = "t"`,
respectively. To omit proportions, use `prop = "n"`.

In the next example, we'll create a simple “2 x 2” table:

```{r}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(smoker, diseased, prop = 'n', totals = FALSE),
           headings = FALSE, method = "render"))
```

## 3 - descr() : Descriptive Univariate Stats

The `descr()` function generates common central tendency statistics and
measures of dispersion for numerical data. It can handle single vectors
as well as data frames, in which case it just ignores non-numerical
columns (and displays a message to that effect).

```{r}
descr(iris, style = "rmarkdown")
```

### Transposing, Selecting Statistics

If your eyes/brain prefer seeing things the other way around, just use
`transpose = TRUE`. Here, we also select only the statistics we wish to
see, and specify `headings = FALSE` to avoid reprinting the same
information as above.

We specify the stats we wish to report with the `stats` argument, which
also accepts values “all”, “fivenum”, and “common”. See `?descr` for 
The full list of available statistics.

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = "common", transpose = TRUE, 
      headings = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

## 4 - dfSummary() : Data Frame Summaries

`dfSummary()` collects information about all variables in a data frame and
displays it in a singe, legible table.

To generate a summary report and have it displayed in RStudio’s 
Viewer pane (or in the default Web browser if working outside RStudio),
we simply do as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(summarytools)
view(dfSummary(iris))
```
<img src="dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png" width=100% style="border:0" />

Of course, it is also possible to use `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents. It
is usually a good idea to exclude a column or two, otherwise the table might be a
bit too wide. For instance, since the _Valid_ and _NA_ columns are redundant, 
we can drop one of them.

```{r}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid", 
          graph.magnif = 0.72, valid.col = FALSE)
```

You probably noticed the message about temporary files being stored in the "img"
subdirectory; the reason why the temporary images are not written
in the system's temporary directory is that by doing so, we would have long
paths to those files, and due to a limitation in _pandoc_, this would mean
extremely wide columns. Using `cleartmp()`, we can delete those temporary
images.


## The print() and view() Functions

**summarytools** has a generic `print` method, `print.summarytools()`. By
default, its `method` argument is set to “pander”. One of the ways in
which `view()` is useful is that we can use it to easily display _html_
outputs in *RStudio*’s Viewer. In this case, the `view()` function
simply acts as a wrapper around the `print()` method, specifying
`method = 'viewer'`. When used outside *RStudio*, this `method` falls back
on “browser” and the report is shown in the system’s default browser.

## Using stby() to Ventilate Results

We can use `stby()` the same way as *R*’s base function `by()` with all main
summarytools functions. This returns a list-type object
containing as many elements as there are categories in the grouping variable.

Using the _iris_ data frame, we will display descriptive statistics
by Species.

```{r}
(iris_stats_by_species <- stby(data = iris, 
                               INDICES = iris$Species, 
                               FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), 
                               transpose = TRUE))
```

To see an _html_ version of these results, we simply use `view()` (also
possible is to use `print()` with `method = "viewer"`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species)
# or
print(iris_stats_by_species, method = "viewer")
```

A special situation occurs when we want grouped statistics 
_for one variable only_ using `descr()`. Instead of showing several tables 
with only one column each, **summarytools** assembles everything into a 
single table:

```{r}
data(tobacco)
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   stby(BMI, age.gr, descr, 
                        stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
print(BMI_by_age, style = "rmarkdown")
```

The transposed version looks like this:

```{r}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   stby(BMI, age.gr, descr,  transpose = TRUE,
                        stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
print(BMI_by_age, style = "rmarkdown", headings = FALSE)
```

### Using stby() with ctable()

The syntax to use is as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stby(list(x = tobacco$smoker, y = tobacco$diseased), tobacco$gender, ctable)
# or equivalently
with(tobacco, stby(list(x = smoker, y = diseased), gender, ctable))
```

## Generating Several Frequency Tables at Once

There is more than one way to do this, but I recommend passing the data frame
object (subsetted if needed) directly to `freq()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
freq(tobacco[ ,c("gender", "age.gr", "smoker")])
```

Another way to do it would be using `lapply()`, but automatic printing
will not be optimal; we'll need to explicitly call the `print()` method
to have proper results (_i.e._ without repeating heading elements).

## Using summarytools in Rmarkdown documents

As we have seen, **summarytools** can generate both text/_markdown_ and _html_
results. Both types of outputs can be used in Rmarkdown documents. The vignette
[Recommendations for Using summarytools With Rmarkdown](library/summarytools/doc/Recommendations-rmarkdown.html)
provides good guidelines, but here are a few tips to get started:

 - Always set the `knitr` chunk option `results = 'asis'`. You can do
   this on a chunk-by-chunk basis, but it is easier to do it globally:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'asis')
```

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Refer to [this page](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for
more on _knitr_'s options.

  - To get better results when generating _html_ output with `method = 'render'`,
    set up your .Rmd document so that it includes **summarytools**’ css. The
    `st_css()` function makes this very easy.

#### Example

````
# ---
# title: "RMarkdown using summarytools"
# output: html_document
# ---
#
# ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# library(knitr)
# opts_chunk$set(comment = NA, prompt = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'asis')
# library(summarytools)
# st_options(plain.ascii = FALSE, 
#            style = "rmarkdown",
#            dfSummary.varnumbers = FALSE,
#            dfSummary.valid.col = FALSE)
#```
#
# ```{r, echo=FALSE}
# st_css()
# ```
#
# ```{r}
# print(dfSummary(tobacco, style = 'grid', graph.magnif = 0.82), 
#       method = 'render', headings = FALSE)
# ```
````

## Writing Output to Files

We can use the `file` argument with `print()` or `view()` to indicate that we want
to save the results in a file, be it _html_, _Rmd_ or plain text. The file extension
indicates what type of file we wish to generate.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```

### Appending Output Files

The `append` argument allows adding content to existing files generated by
**summarytools**. This is useful if you want to quickly include several statistical
tables in a single file. It is a quick alternative to creating an _.Rmd_ document.

## Global options

The following options can be set with `st_options()`:

**General Options** 

| Option name               | Default   | Note                                         |

st_options('round.digits')        # display the value of a specific option
st_options(style = 'rmarkdown')   # change one or several options' values
st_options(footnote = NA)         # Turn off the footnote on all outputs.
                                  # This option was used prior to generating
                                  # the present document.
```

## Overriding formatting attributes

When a **summarytools** object is created, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, you can override most of them when using the
`print()` method or the `view()` function.

### Overriding Function-Specific Arguments


| Argument       | freq | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| -------------: | :--: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| style          |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| round.digits   |  x   |   x    |   x   |           |
| plain.ascii    |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| justify        |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| headings       |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| display.labels |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| varnumbers     |      |        |       |     x     |
| labels.col     |      |        |       |     x     |
| graph.col      |      |        |       |     x     |
| valid.col      |      |        |       |     x     |
| na.col         |      |        |       |     x     |
| col.widths     |      |        |       |     x     |
| split.tables   |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| report.nas     |  x   |        |       |           |
| display.type   |  x   |        |       |           |
| missing        |  x   |        |       |           |
| totals         |  x   |   x    |       |           |
| caption        |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |


### Overriding Headings Content

| Argument           | freq | ctable | descr | dfSummary |
| -----------------: | :--: | :----: | :---: | :-------: |
| Data.frame         |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Data.frame.label   |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Variable           |  x   |   x    |   x   |           |
| Variable.label     |  x   |   x    |   x   |           |
| Group              |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| date               |  x   |   x    |   x   |     x     |
| Weights            |  x   |        |   x   |           |
| Data.type          |  x   |        |       |     x     |
| Row.variable       |      |   x    |       |     x     |
| Col.variable       |      |   x    |       |     x     |


#### Example 

```{r}
age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)  # age_stats contains a regular output for freq 
                                   # including headings, NA counts, and Totals
print(age_stats, style = "rmarkdown", report.nas = FALSE, 
                 totals = FALSE, Variable.label = "Age Group")
```

Note that the original attributes are still part of the _age\_stats_ object,
left unchanged.

## Order of Priority for Options / Parameters

1.  Options overridden explicitly in `print()` or `view()` have
    precedence
2.  options specified as explicit arguments to `freq() / ctable() /
    descr() / dfSummary()` come second
3.  Global options, which can be set with `st_options`, come third

## Customizing looks with CSS

**summarytools** uses *RStudio*’s
[htmltools package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)
and version 4 of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)’s cascading
stylesheets.

It is possible to include your own _css_ if you wish to customize the
look of the output tables. See `?print.summarytools` for all the details,
but here is a quick example.

Say you need to make the font size really really small. For this,
you would create a _.css_ file - let’s call it “custom.css” -
containing a class definition such as the following:

```css
.tiny-text {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```
Then, to apply it to a **summarytools** object and display it in your
browser:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
     table.classes = 'tiny-text')
```

To display a smaller table that is not **that** small, you can use the
**provided css class `st-small`**.

## Working with _Shiny_ apps

To include **summarytools** functions in _Shiny_ apps, it is recommended that 
you:

 - set `bootstrap.css = FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - omit headings by setting the global option `headings = FALSE`
 - adjust the size of the graphs in `dfSummary()` using the `dfSummary.graph.magnif`
   gobal option
 - if `dfSummary()` outputs are too wide, try omitting a column or two
   (`valid.col` and `varnumbers`, for instance)
 - if needed, set the column widths manually with the `col.widths` parameter of the 
   `print()` method or the `view()` function
 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

## Latest Changes and Improvements {#changes}

As stated earlier, version 0.9 brings **many** improvements
to **summarytools**. This 
[vignette](library/summarytools/doc/Changes-Introduced-in-Version-0-9.html) 
gives a detailed description of the changes, but here are the main elements:

 - Translations
   + For now, only a limited number of languages are available (fr, es, ru), but
     as users contribute their own translations, the list will hopefully grow
     much larger
   + To use a different language than English, call the `st_options()` function, 
     like so: `st_options(lang = "fr")
   + An additional function, `useTranslations()` allows using custom
     translations; a template is available
     [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcomtois/summarytools/master/translations/language_template.csv)
 - Improved printing of list objects
   + Objects of class “stby” are automatically printed in the console with
     optimal results; no more need for `view(x, method = "pander")`;
     simply use `stby()` instead of `by()`
   + Regular lists containing **summarytools** objects can also be printed with
     optimal results simply by calling `print(x)` (as opposed to “stby” objects,
     their automatic printing will **not** be optimal; that being said, `freq()`
     now accepts data frames as its first argument, so the need for `lapply()`
     is greatly diminished)
 - Easier management of global settings with `st_options()` 
   + `st_options()` now has as many parameters as there are
     options to set, making it possible to set all options 
     with only one function call; the legacy way of setting
     options is still supported however
   + Several global options were added, simplifying *Rmarkdown* document
     creation
 - Changes to `dfSummary()`
   + Now fully compatible with _Rmarkdown_
   + Number of columns is now included in the heading section
   + Number of duplicated rows is also shown in the heading section
   + Bar plots now more accurately reflect counts, as they are not stretched
     across table cells (this allows the comparison of frequencies across 
     variables)
   + Columns with particular content (unary/binary, integer sequences, UPC/EAN
     codes) are treated differently; more relevant information is displayed,
     while irrelevant information is hidden
   + For _html_ outputs, a new parameter `col.widths` may be used to set the
     width of the resulting table's columns; this addresses an issue
     with some graphs not being shown at the desired magnification level (although
     much effort has been put into improving this as well)
   + Graph background transparency "works" in a more consistent way
 - Changes to `descr()`
   + For the `stats` argument, Values “fivenum” and “common” are now allowed,
     the latter representing the collection of _mean_, _sd_, _min_, _med_,
     _max_, _n.valid_, and _pct.valid_
   + Improved outputs when using `stby()` 
   + The variable used for weights (if any) is removed automatically from the
     data so no stats are produced for it
 - Changes to `freq()`
   + As mentioned earlier, the function now accepts data frames as its main 
     argument; this makes practically obsolete the use of `lapply()` with it
  + Improved outputs when using `stby()`
 - Changes to `ctable()`
   + Fully supports `stby()`
   + Number alignment in _html_ tables much improved

**Other notable changes** 

 - The `omit.headings` parameter has been replaced by the more straightforward
   (and still boolean) `headings`. `omit.heandings` is still supported 
   but will be deprecated in future releases
 - Because it was subject to errors, the _Rows Subset_ heading element
   has been removed. If there is a strong need for it, I can bring it back in a 
   future release (just let me known by email or on GitHub if you'd like to have
   it back)
 - Under the hood, much has been going on; the lengthier functions have been
   split into more manageable parts, and several normalizing operations were
   performed, facilitating maintenance and improving code readability
