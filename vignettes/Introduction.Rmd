**summarytools** is an _[R](http://r-project.org)_ package providing tools to neatly and quickly summarize data, with functions that most R programmers once wished were included in base R. It can also make _R_ a little easier to use for newcomeRs. With a few lines of simple code, one can get a good look at the data at hand.

An emphasis has been put on both _what_ and _how_ results are presented, so that the package can serve both as a data exploration _and_ reporting tool than can be used either on its own for minimal reports, or integrated in a larger set of tools such as RStudio's for [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/).

## Four Core Functions

The package is built around four main functions:

- **freq()** -- _Frequency tables_ with proportions, cumulative proportions and missing data information
- **ctable()** -- _Cross-Tabulations_ with row, column, or total proportions, as well as marginal totals
- **descr()** -- _Descriptive (univariate) statistics_ for numerical vectors which is more thorough than `fivenum()` and other similar functions
- **dfSummary()** -- _Data frame summaries_ that facilitate data cleaning and firsthand evaluation

## Output Options

All _summarytools_ objects returned by the main functions can be:

- Displayed as plain text in the console (default behavior)
- Redirected to plain text, _markdown_ or HTML documents
- Rendered to HTML and shown in default Web Browser or in _RStudio_'s Viewer

Text-based output relies on the [pander](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) package, while html output relies on RStudio's [htmltools](https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools).


## Bare-Bones Example: Frequency Table

To show what default (console) outputs look like, we first generate a frequency table for _iris$Species_.

```{r barebones}
freq(iris$Species)
```

To get familiar with the output styles, one can try different values for _style=_ and see how results look in the console. 

### Markdown Outputs

When using _style='rmarkdown'_ with `freq()` or `descr()`, the generated outputs are ready for markdown rendering. With `dfSummary()`, options for _style_ are "multiline" (default) and "grid", and _plain.ascii=FALSE_ must be used to have proper line feeds in multiline cells.

_Note:_ If building a document using an _.Rmd_ document with _knitr_, always set the chunk option _results_ to "asis":

````
```{r, results='asis'}`r ''`
library(summarytools)  
freq(tobacco$smoker, style='rmarkdown')  
```
````

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(summarytools)  
freq(tobacco$smoker, style='rmarkdown')
```


## Descriptive (Univariate) Statistics

The `descr()` function accepts both vectors and data frames, in which case it will show statistics for all numerical variables it contains. We'll use one of the datasets included in the package.

```{r descr_md, results='asis'}
data(exams)
descr(exams[ ,3:5], style='rmarkdown')
```

To rather see variables in rows and stats in columns, use _transpose=TRUE_:

```{r descr_md2, eval=FALSE}
descr(exams, style = 'rmarkdown', transpose = TRUE)
```

### Cross-Tabulations

Let a few examples speak for themselves...

```{r ctable1}
with(tobacco, ctable(smoker, diseased))
```

The type of table generated by ctable() is unfortunately not (yet) supported by _rmarkdown_. But we can turn to the _render_ method to circumvent this:

```{r render_html, results='asis'}
crosstable <- with(tobacco, ctable(smoker, diseased))
print(crosstable, method='render', footnote = NA)
```

### Data frame Summaries

This is the most elaborate function of the package. It incorporates elements of freq() and descr(), but goes beyond with its graphs (not yet supported in _rmarkdown_) and other attributes. 

```{r dfSummary1, results='asis'}
dfSummary(tobacco, style='grid', plain.ascii = FALSE, graph.col = FALSE)
```

For this one, we can use styles "multiline" (default) or "grid". We **must** however specify _plain.ascii=FALSE_ when using markdown, otherwise the rendered results will be problematic.

## Redirecting Output

### Text/Markdown Documents

Using the _file=_ parameter with the `view()` or `print()` functions, we can redirect output into text files. And setting _append=TRUE_ will append results to an existing text file:

```{r redir, eval=FALSE}
my_summary <- dfSummary(tobacco)  
print(my_summary, file = "tobacco.txt", style = "grid")  # Creates tobacco.txt
my_stats <- descr(tobacco)
print(my_stats, file="tobacco.txt", append = TRUE) # Appends results to tobacco.txt
```

As you may have noticed, the _style_ argument was used when calling the `print()` function. We could also have used it when calling the `dfSummary()` and `descr()` functions, in which case the style would have been written in the objects' properties. Using this argument with `print()` overrides the style that is stored in the object. It is one of several arguments that can be used that way. See the documentation for `print()` to know all the details.

### HTML Documents

_summarytools_ uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#tables)'s stylesheets to generate standalone HTML documents that can be displayed in a Web Browser or in _RStudio_'s Viewer using the generic `print()` function:

```{r view_html, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), method = 'browser')  # Displays results in default Web Browser
print(dfSummary(tobacco), method = 'viewer')   # Displays results in RStudio's Viewer
view(dfSummary(tobacco))                       # Same as line above -- view() is a wrapper function
```

Using _file=_ argument with an .html extension will simply generate an HTML document (without opening it). 

```{r create_html, eval=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(tobacco), file = '~/Documents/tobacco_summary.html')
```

Here is a picture of the output:

<img src="/home/dominic/R/summarytools/img/dfSummary-tobacco.png" alt="dfSummary in HTML format" style="width: 680px;"/>

As with simple text files, you can also append existing HTML reports with additionnal content.


## Using _by()_, _with()_, and _lapply()_

Summarytools functions support the use of `by()`, `with()`, and `lapply()`, at least when used in good measure. 

Since objects generated by those native functions have their own class (they are special lists containing summarytools objects), they are not sent to the package's generic print method automatically. In order to have the best results, the following method is recommended: First, store the object generated by one of the native functions. Then, use `view()` either with _method='pander'_ to show results in console, or omitting the _method_ argument to see (HTML) results in the Viewer or Browser.

```{r by_stats1, results='asis'}
stats <- by(data = exams$geography, INDICES = exams$gender, FUN = descr, style = 'rmarkdown')
view(stats, method = 'pander')
```

## Other Tricks To Try Out

There are many things you can do to build elaborate, fine-tuned reports. Let's mention a few...

- For HTML reports, footnotes can be customized or removed
- For text reports, captions can be added with the `caption=` argument
- Text files as well as HTML files can be appended with as many results you need
- Custom CSS can be added -- you can specify custom classes for any table you generate
  For instance:
```r
view(with(tobacco, ctable(gender, smoker)), 
     report.title = "Summary of the tobacco sample data frame",
      html.table.class = "table table-bordered table-striped table-responsive",
      footnote = "Extended use of Bootstrap classes")
```

## Getting Most Properties of an Object With `what.is()`

When developing, we often use a number functions to obtain an object's properties. `what.is()` proposes to lump together the results of such functions (`class()`, `typeof()`, `attributes()` and others).

```{r what_is, warning=FALSE}
what.is(iris)
```

## Limitations

- The graph column in dfSummary is not yet supported in _rmarkdown_  
- When using negative indexing, column names might not be displayed  
- It is not possible to control the heading levels of individual heading items

### Final note
The source of this document is an .Rmd file; _knitr_'s chunk option `results` has been set to `'asis'`, to make sure formatting is not coming from _knitr_ itself.
