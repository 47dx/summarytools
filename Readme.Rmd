# What is summarytools?

*summarytools* is an [R](http://r-project.org) package providing tools to _neatly and quickly summarize data_. Its main purpose is to provide hassle-free functions that every _R_ programmer once wished were included in base R:

- `descr()` : **descriptive statistics** with all common univariate statistics for numerical vectors.
- `freq()` : **frequency tables** with proportions, cumulative proportions and missing data information.
- `ctable()` : **cross-tabulations** between two factors or any discrete data, with total, rows or columns proportions.
- `dfSummary()` : Extensive **data frame summaries** that facilitate data cleaning and firsthand evaluation.

Most commercial statistical software suites provide a wide range of functions and procedures out-of-the-box, making it very simple to create, with code or with a few point-and-click actions, well-formatted reports. For most tasks not relying on advanced statistical methods, _summarytools_ allows you to do just that. 

# How to install

To benefit from all the latests fixes, install it from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('dcomtois/summarytools')
```

To install the most recent version on the _R-CRAN_ repository, just type into your _R_ console: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("summarytools")
```

For enthusiastic users, I encourage you to go for the **development** version, which is the most up-to-date, **but** might also contain bugs (which can be fixed rapidly in most cases). Having some of you work with it will help me identify potential problems.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('dcomtois/summarytools', ref='dev-current')
```

You can see the source code and documentation on the official _R_ site [here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/).

# Latest News
Version 0.8.3 brings several improvements to summarytools, notably:

 - Introduction of global settings (customizable defaults)
 - Options to make content fit more naturally in _shiny_ apps or _Rmarkdown_ documents
 - A better handling of "split-group" statistics with `by()`
 - A more thorough documentation
 <!-- - `dfSummary()` now supports Date / POSIX data  -->
 <!-- - in `descr()`, Q1 and Q3 are now included -->
 <!-- - Also in `descr()`, the order of the statistics specified with `stats =` is retained for the output -->


# A First Example - Data Frame Summary

Using the _iris_ sample data frame, we'll jump right to the most popular function in the package, `dfSummary` (*Data Frame Summary*). 

With the following tiny bit of code, we'll generate a summary report for _iris_ and have it displayed in [_RStudio_](http://www.rstudio.com/)'s Viewer pane:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the package
library(summarytools)

# Generate the summary
view(dfSummary(iris))
```

![Example of dfSummary Output displayed in RStudio's viewer](img/dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png)

##### Building on the strengths of [pander](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) and [htmltools](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmltools/index.html), the outputs produced by summarytools can be:

- Displayed in plain text in the _R_ console (default behaviour) 
- Used in _Rmardown_ documents and _knitted_ along with other text and _R_ output
- Written to _html_  files that fire up in [_RStudio_](http://www.rstudio.com/)'s Viewer pane or in your system's default browser
- Written to plain text files / _Rmarkdown_ text files 

Some people have successfully included some of the package's functions in _shiny apps_, too!

# Core Function # 1 - freq()

The `freq()` function generates a table of frequencies with counts and proportions. Since this page use _markdown_ rendering, we'll set `style = 'rmarkdown'` to take advantage of it.

```{r}
library(summarytools)
freq(iris$Species, style = "rmarkdown")
```

If we do not worry about missing data, we can set `report.nas = FALSE`:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

We could furthermore omit the _Totals_ row by setting `totals = FALSE`.

# Core Function # 2 - descr()
The `descr()` function generates common central tendency statistics and measures of dispersion for numerical data. It can handle single vectors as well as data frames, in which case it just ignores non-numerical columns (and displays a message to that effect).

```{r}
descr(iris, style = "rmarkdown")
```

## Transposing and selecting the stats you need 

If your eyes/brain prefer seeing things the other way around, just use `transpose = TRUE`. Here, we also select only the statistics we wish to see, and specify `omit.headings = TRUE` to avoid reprinting the same information as above.

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), transpose = TRUE, 
      omit.headings = TRUE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

# Core Function # 3 - ctable()

We'll now use a sample data frame called _tobacco_, which is included in the package. We want to cross-tabulate the two categorical variables `smoker` and `diseased`. By default, `ctable()` gives row proportions, but we'll include the full syntax anyway.

Since _markdown_ has not support (yet) for multi-line headings, we'll show an image of the resulting html table.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
with(tobacco, view(ctable(smoker, diseased)))
```

![Example of ctable() output](img/ctable-with-row-props.png)

Notice that instead of `ctable(tobacco$smoker, tobacco$diseased, ...)`, we used the `with()` function, making the syntax less redundant.

It is possible to display _column_, _total_, or no proportions at all. We can also omit the marginal totals to have a simple "2 x 2" table. 

```{r, results='markup'}
with(tobacco, ctable(smoker, diseased, prop = 'n', totals = FALSE, 
                     omit.headings = TRUE, style = "simple"))
```


# Core Function # 4 - dfSummary()

As seen earlier, `dfSummary()` collects information about all variables in a data frame and displays it in a singe, legible table.

* Note that due to rmarkdown compatibility issues, the text graphs being histograms are not shown. We're working on this.

```{r}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid")
```

# The print() and view() Functions

_summarytools_ has a generic `print` method, `print.summarytools()`. By default, its `method` argument is set to `'pander'`. One of the ways in which `view()` is useful is that we can use it To easily display _html_ outputs in _RStudio_'s Viewer. In this case, the `view()` function simply acts as a wrapper around the generic `print()` function, specifying the `method = 'viewer'` for us. When used outside _RStudio_, the `method` falls back on `'browser'` and the report is fired up in the system's default browser.

# Using by() to Show Results By Groups

With `freq()` and `descr()`, you can use _R_'s base function `by()` to have statistics split by a ventilation variable (which must be categorical). _R_'s `by()` function returns a `list` containing as many _summarytools_ objects as there are categories in our ventilation variable. To propertly display the content present in that list, we use the `view()` function. Not doing so would give somewhat messy and redundant results. 

#### Example

Using the _iris_ data frame, we will display descriptive statistics broken down by Species.

```{r}
# First save the results
iris_stats_by_species <- by(data = iris, 
                            INDICES = iris$Species, 
                            FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), 
                            transpose = TRUE)
# Then use view(), like so:
view(iris_stats_by_species, method = "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

To see an _html_ version of these results, we'd simply do this (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species)
```

### Special Case - Using descr() With by() For A Single Variable

Instead of showing several tables having only one column each, the `view()` function will assemble the results into a single table:

```{r}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   by(BMI, age.gr, descr, 
                      stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
view(BMI_by_age, "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

The transposed version looks like this:

```{r}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   by(BMI, age.gr, descr,  transpose = TRUE,
                      stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
view(BMI_by_age, "pander", style = "rmarkdown", omit.headings = TRUE)
```


# Using lapply() to Show Several freq() tables at once

As is the case for `by()`, the `view()` function is essential for making results nice and tidy.

```{r}
tobacco_subset <- tobacco[ ,c("gender", "age.gr", "smoker")]
freq_tables <- lapply(tobacco_subset, freq)
view(freq_tables, method = "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

# Using summarytools in Rmarkdown documents

As we have seen, _summarytools_ can generate both text (including rmarkdown) and html results. Both can be used in Rmarkdown, according to your preferences. See [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/vignettes/Recommendations-rmarkdown.html) to get all the details, but if you're in a hurry, here are a few tips to get started:

- Always set the `knitr` chunk option `results = 'asis'`. You can do this on a chunk-by-chunk basis, but here is how to do it globally:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'asis')
```

Refer to [this page](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for more on _knitr_'s options.

- To get better results when using html (with `method = 'render'`), set up your .Rmd document so it includes _summarytool_'s css.

#### Example

````
# ---
# title: "RMarkdown using summarytools"
# output: 
#   html_document: 
#     css: C:/R/win-library/3.4/summarytools/includes/stylesheets/summarytools.css
# ---

# ```{r, results='asis'}
# library(summarytools)  
# freq(tobacco$smoker, style='rmarkdown')  
# 
# print(dfSummary(tobacco, style = 'grid', plain.ascii = FALSE, graph.magnif = 0.85), 
#       method = 'render', omit.headings = TRUE)
# ```
````
![Example of rendered output](img/dfSummary-render-in-markdown.png)


# Writing Output to Files

The console will always tell you the location of the temporary _html_ file that is created in the process. However, you can specify the name and location of that file explicitly if you need to reuse it later on:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```

There is also an `append = ` logical argument for adding content to existing reports, both text/Rmarkdown and html.

# Global options

Version 0.8.3 introduced the following set of global options:

  - `round.digits` = `2`
  - `plain.ascii` = `TRUE`
  - `omit.headings` = `FALSE` (if using in a markdown document or a shiny app, setting this to `TRUE` might be preferable
  - `footnote` = `'default'` (set to empty string or `NA` to omit footnote)
  - `display.labels` = `TRUE`
  - `freq.totals` = `TRUE`
  - `freq.display.nas` = `TRUE`
  - `ctable.totals` = `TRUE`
  - `ctable.prop` = `'r'` (display *r*ow proportions by default)
  - `descr.stats` = `'all'`
  - `descr.transpose` = `FALSE`
  - `bootstrap.css` = `TRUE` (if using in a markdown document or a shiny app, setting this to `FALSE` might be preferable
  - `custom.css` = `NA` 
  - `escape.pipe` = `FALSE`

#### Examples

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_options()                      # display all global options' values
st_options('round.digits')        # display only one option
st_options('omit.headings', TRUE) # change an option's value
st_options('footnote', NA)        # Turn off the footnote on all outputs.
                                  # This option was used prior to generating
                                  # the present document.
```


# Overriding formatting attributes

When a _summarytools_ object is stored, its formatting attributes are stored with it. However, you can override most of them when using the `print()` and `view()` functions.

### Example 

```{r}
age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)  # age_stats contains a regular output for freq 
                                   # including headings, NA counts, and Totals
print(age_stats, style = "rmarkdown", report.nas = FALSE, 
                 totals = FALSE, omit.headings = TRUE)
```

Note that the omitted attributes are stil part of the _age\_stats_ object.

## Order of Priority for Options / Parameters

1. Options over-ridden explicitly with `print()` or `view()` have precendence
2. options specified as explicit arguments to `freq() / ctable() / descr() / dfSummary()` come second
3. Global options, which can be set with `st_options`, come third

# Customizing looks with CSS

Version 0.8.0 of _summarytools_ uses _RStudio_'s [htmltools package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmltools/index.html) and version 4 of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)'s cascading stylesheets.

It is possible to include your own _css_ if you wish to customize the look of the output tables. See the documentation for the package's `print.summarytools()` function for details, but here is a quick example to give you the gist of it.

### Example

Say you need to make the font size really, really tiny. For this, you create a CSS file - let's call it "custom.css" - containing the following class:

```css
.table-condensed {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

To apply it to a _summarytools_ object and display it in your browser, you would do like this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
     table.classes = 'table-condensed')
```

# Working with _shiny_ apps

To include _summarytools_ functions into _shiny_ apps, it is recommended that you:
 - set `bootstrap.css = FASE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout.
 - adjust the size of the graphs in `dfSummary()`
 - omit headings
 
For example:

```r
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      omit.headings = TRUE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

## Final notes

The package comes with no guarantees. It is a work in progress and feedback / feature requests are welcome. Just send me an email (dominic.comtois (at) gmail.com), or open an [Issue](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools/issues) if you find a bug.

Also, the package grew significantly larger, and maintaining it all by myself is time consuming. If you would like to contribute, please get in touch, I'd greatly appreciate the help.
