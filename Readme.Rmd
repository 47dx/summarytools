# What is summarytools?

*summarytools* is an [R](http://r-project.org) package providing tools
to *neatly and quickly summarize data*. It can also make _R_ a little easier to 
learn and use. Four functions are at the core of the package:

  - `freq()` : **frequency tables** with proportions, cumulative
    proportions and missing data information.
  - `ctable()` : **cross-tabulations** between two factors or any
    discrete data, with total, rows or columns proportions, as well
    as marginal totals.
  - `descr()` : **descriptive (univariate) statistics** for numerical vectors.
  - `dfSummary()` : Extensive **data frame summaries** that facilitate
    data cleaning and firsthand evaluation.

An emphasis has been put on both _what_ and _how_ results are presented, so that the
package can serve both as a data exploration _and_ reporting tool, which can be used
either on its own for minimal reports, or along with larger sets of tools such as
RStudio's for [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/).

**Building on the strengths of [pander](https://github.com/Rapporter/pander) and
[htmltools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)**, the 
outputs produced by summarytools can be:

  - Displayed in plain text in the *R* console (default behaviour)
  - Used in *Rmarkdown* documents and *knitted* along with other text and
    *R* output
  - Written to *html* files that fire up in
    [*RStudio*](http://www.rstudio.com/)’s Viewer pane or in your
    system’s default browser
  - Written to plain text files / *Rmarkdown* text files

Some people have successfully included some of the package’s functions
in *shiny apps*, too\!

### Latest Improvements and changes
Version 0.8.9 brings several improvements to *summarytools*, notably:

 - Easier management of global settings (customizable defaults) with 
   `st_options()`; each option has its own parameter, so you can set as many
   as you need in just one function call. The legacy way of setting options
   is still supported
 - `dfSummary()` went through somw changes:
    + number of culumns is shown in heading, as well as number of duplicated rows 
      (credits to [Paul Feitsma](https://github.com/paulfeitsma) for the good idea)
    + UPC and EAN codes are now detected as well as sequences of integers 
      (thanks to Paul one more)
    + barplots more accurately reflect counts as they are no more "stretched"
      to the width of the table "cells"; this allows comparing counts across
      variables
    + Binary and unary columns no more show irrelevant statistics (IQR / CV)
 - `descr()` allows two new values for the `stats` parameter: "fivenum" and
    "common", the latter being a shortcut for `c("mean", "sd", "min", "med",`
    `"max", "n.valid", "pct.valid")`
 - Many More options can be overridden when printing / viewing summarytools 
   objects; refer to `print.summarytools()`'s documentation for details

**Other notable changes:**   

 - The `omit.headings` parameter has been replaced by the more straightforward
   `headings`. `omit.heandings` is still supported in this version but will be
   deprecated in the future
 - Finally, because it was subject to errors, the _Rows Subset_ heading element
   has been removed. In case of a massive public outry, I'll bring it back ;)
 - Under the hood, much has been going; the lengthier functions have been
   split into more manageable parts, facilitating maintenance and improving 
   readability 
   

# How to install

To benefit from all the latest fixes, install it from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('dcomtois/summarytools')
```

To install the most recent version on the _R-CRAN_ repository: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("summarytools")
```

For enthusiastic users willing to contribute to _summarytools_' development,
I encourage you to go for the **development** version, which is the most
up-to-date, but also a _work-in-progress_. Bugs may show up, but if you
report them I can generally fix them quickly.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github('dcomtois/summarytools', ref='dev-current')
```

You can see the source code and documentation on the official _R_ site
[here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/summarytools/).


# Four Core Functions
## 1 - freq() : Frequency Tables

The `freq()` function generates a table of frequencies with counts and
proportions. Since this page use *markdown* rendering, we’ll set `style
= 'rmarkdown'` to take advantage of it.

```{r}
library(summarytools)
freq(iris$Species, style = "rmarkdown")
```

If we do not worry about missing data, we can set `report.nas = FALSE`:

```{r}
freq(iris$Species, report.nas = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown", headings = FALSE)
```

We could furthermore omit the _Totals_ row by setting `totals = FALSE`.

## 2 - ctable() : Cross-Tabulations

We’ll now use a sample data frame called *tobacco*, which is included in
the package. We want to cross-tabulate the two categorical variables
`smoker` and `diseased`. By default, `ctable()` gives row proportions,
but we’ll include the full syntax anyway.

Since *markdown* has not support (yet) for multi-line headings, we’ll
show an image of the resulting html table.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
with(tobacco, view(ctable(smoker, diseased)))
```

![Example of ctable() output](img/ctable-with-row-props.png)

Notice that instead of `ctable(tobacco$smoker, tobacco$diseased, ...)`,
we used the `with()` function, making the syntax less redundant.

It is possible to display *column*, *total*, or no proportions at all.
We can also omit the marginal totals to have a simple _2 x 2_ table.

```{r, results='markup'}
with(tobacco, 
     print(ctable(smoker, diseased, prop = 'n', totals = FALSE),
           headings = FALSE, method = 'render'))
```


## 3 - descr() : Descriptive Univariate Stats 

The `descr()` function generates common central tendency statistics and
measures of dispersion for numerical data. It can handle single vectors
as well as data frames, in which case it just ignores non-numerical
columns (and displays a message to that effect).

```{r}
descr(iris, style = "rmarkdown")
```

### Transposing and selecting only the stats you need

If your eyes/brain prefer seeing things the other way around, just use
`transpose = TRUE`. Here, we also select only the statistics we wish to
see, and specify `headings = FALSE` to avoid reprinting the same
information as above.

You can specify the stats you wish to report with the `stats` argument, which
also accepts special values `all`, `fivenum`, and  `common`.

```{r}
descr(iris, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), transpose = TRUE, 
      headings = FALSE, style = "rmarkdown")
```

## 4 - dfSummary() : Data Frame Summaries

`dfSummary()` collects information about all variables
in a data frame and displays it in a singe, legible table.

#### Examples

With the following tiny bit of code, we’ll generate a summary report for
the *iris* data frame and have it displayed in [*RStudio*](http://www.rstudio.com/)’s
Viewer pane:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the package
library(summarytools)

# Generate the summary
view(dfSummary(iris))
```

![Example of dfSummary Output displayed in RStudio's viewer](img/dfSummary_in_RStudio_Viewer.png)

It is also possible to use `dfSummary()` in *Rmarkdown* documents. In this next example, 
note that due to rmarkdown compatibility issues, histograms are not shown. We’re working
on this. Further down, we'll see how to use _html_ rendering to go around this problem.

```{r}
dfSummary(tobacco, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid")
```

## The print() and view() Functions

*summarytools* has a generic `print` method, `print.summarytools()`. By
default, its `method` argument is set to `'pander'`. One of the ways in
which `view()` is useful is that we can use it to easily display *html*
outputs in *RStudio*’s Viewer. In this case, the `view()` function
simply acts as a wrapper around the generic `print()` function,
specifying `method = 'viewer'`. When used outside *RStudio*,
the `method` falls back on `'browser'` and the generated file is opened in the
system’s default browser.

## Using by() to Show Results By Groups

With `freq()` and `descr()`, you can use *R*’s base function `by()` to
show statistics split by a ventilation / categorical variable. *R*’s
`by()` function returns a `list` containing as many *summarytools* objects
as there are categories in our ventilation variable. 

To properly display the content present in that list, **we use
the `view()` function**. Using `print()`, while technically possible,
will not give as much satisfactory results.

#### Example

Using the _iris_ data frame, we will display descriptive statistics
broken down by Species.

```{r}
# First save the results
iris_stats_by_species <- by(data = iris, 
                            INDICES = iris$Species, 
                            FUN = descr, stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max"), 
                            transpose = TRUE)
# Then use view(), like so:
view(iris_stats_by_species, method = "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

To see an _html_ version of these results, we'd simply do this (results not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species)
```

### Special Case - Using descr() With by() For A Single Variable

Instead of showing several tables having only one column each, the
`view()` function will assemble the results into a single table:

```{r}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   by(BMI, age.gr, descr, 
                      stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
view(BMI_by_age, "pander", style = "rmarkdown")
```

The transposed version looks like this:

```{r}
BMI_by_age <- with(tobacco, 
                   by(BMI, age.gr, descr,  transpose = TRUE,
                      stats = c("mean", "sd", "min", "med", "max")))
view(BMI_by_age, "pander", style = "rmarkdown", headings = FALSE)
```

## Using lapply() to Show Several freq() tables at once

As is the case for `by()`, the `view()` function is essential for making
results nice and tidy.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tobacco_subset <- tobacco[ ,c("gender", "age.gr", "smoker")]
freq_tables <- lapply(tobacco_subset, freq)
view(freq_tables, footnote = NA, file = 'freq-tables.html')
```


## Using summarytools in Rmarkdown documents

As we have seen, *summarytools* can generate both text (including
rmarkdown) and html results. Both can be used in Rmarkdown, according to
your preferences. The vignette mentioned at the top of this page is dedicated to
showing examples, but if you’re in a hurry, here are a few tips to
get started:

 - Always set the `knitr` chunk option `results = 'asis'`. You can do
   this on a chunk-by-chunk basis, but here is how to do it globally:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, results = 'asis')
```

\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Refer to [this page](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) for
more on _knitr_'s options.

  - To get better results when using html (with `method = 'render'`),
    set up your .Rmd document so it includes *summarytool*’s css.

#### Example

````
# ---
# title: "RMarkdown using summarytools"
# output: 
#   html_document: 
#     css: C:/R/win-library/3.4/summarytools/includes/stylesheets/summarytools.css
# ---

# ```{r, results='asis'}
# library(summarytools)  
# 
# print(dfSummary(tobacco, style = 'grid', plain.ascii = FALSE, graph.magnif = 0.85), 
#       method = 'render', headings = FALSE)
# ```
````
![Example of rendered output](img/dfSummary-render-in-markdown.png)


## Writing Output to Files

The console will always tell you the location of the temporary *html*
file that is created in the process. However, you can specify the name
and location of that file explicitly if you need to reuse it later on:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(iris_stats_by_species, file = "~/iris_stats_by_species.html")
```

Based on the file extension you provide (_.html_ vs others), _summarytools_ will
use the appropriate method; there is no need to specify the `method` argument.

### Appending output files

There is also an `append =` logical argument for adding content to
existing reports, both text/Rmarkdown and html. This is useful if you want to
quickly include several statistical tables in a single file. It is fast 
alternative to creating an _.Rmd_ document if you don't need the extra
content that the latter allows.

## Global options

The following options are customizable with `st_options()`:

**General options** 

| Option name               | Default   | Note                                         |
| ------------------------: | --------: | :------------------------------------------- |
| style                     | "simple"  | Set to "rmarkdown" when necessary            |
| plain.ascii               |    TRUE   | Set to FALSE when doing rmarkdown            |
| round.digits              |       2   | Number of decimals to show                   |
| headings (*)              |    TRUE   | Formerly 'omit.headings'                     |
| footnote                  | "default" | Personalize, or set to NA to omit            |
| display.labels            |    TRUE   | Show variable / data frame labels in heading |
| bootstrap.css (*)         |    TRUE   | Include Bootstrap 4 css in html              |
| custom.css                |      NA   | Path to your own css file                    |
| escape.pipe               |   FALSE   | Useful with some Pandoc conversions          |

  (*) In rmarkdown or in Shiny apps, better set to FALSE

**Function-specific options**

| Option name               | Default   | Note                                    |
| ------------------------: | --------: | :-------------------------------------- |
| freq.totals               |    TRUE   | Display totals row in freq()            |
| freq.report.nas           |    TRUE   | Display <NA> row and "valid" columns    |
| ctable.prop               |     "r"   | Display **r**ow proportions by default  |
| ctable.totals             |    TRUE   | Show marginal totals                    |
| descr.stats               |    "all"  | "fivenum", "common" or list of stats    |
| descr.transpose           |   FALSE   |                                         |
| dfSummary.varnumbers      |    TRUE   | Show variable numbers in 1st col.       |
| dfSummary.labels.col      |    TRUE   | Show variable labels when present       |
| dfSummary.graph.col       |    TRUE   |                                         |
| dfSummary.valid.col       |    TRUE   |                                         |
| dfSummary.na.col          |    TRUE   |                                         |
| dfSummary.graph.magnif    |       1   | Zoom factor for barplots and histograms |

#### Examples

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_options()                      # display all global options values
st_options('round.digits')        # display the value of a specific option
st_options(style = 'rmarkdown')   # change one or several options' values
st_options(footnote = NA)         # Turn off the footnote on all outputs.
                                  # This option was used prior to generating
                                  # the present document.
```


## Overriding formatting attributes

When a *summarytools* object is stored, its formatting attributes are
stored within it. However, you can override most of them when using the
`print()` and `view()` functions.


#### Example 

```{r}
age_stats <- freq(tobacco$age.gr)  # age_stats contains a regular output for freq 
                                   # including headings, NA counts, and Totals
print(age_stats, style = "rmarkdown", report.nas = FALSE, 
                 totals = FALSE, headings = FALSE)
```

Note that the overridden attributes are stil part of the _age\_stats_ object.

## Order of Priority for options

1.  Options overridden explicitly with `print()` or `view()` have
    precendence
2.  options specified as explicit arguments to `freq() / ctable() /
    descr() / dfSummary()` come second
3.  Global options, which can be set with `st_options`, come third

## Customizing looks with CSS

Version 0.8 of *summarytools* uses *RStudio*’s [htmltools
package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=htmltools)
and version 4 of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)’s cascading
stylesheets.

It is possible to include your own *css* if you wish to customize the
look of the output tables. See the documentation for the package’s
`print.summarytools()` function for details, but here is a quick example
to give you the gist of it.

#### Example

Say you need to make the font size really, really small. For this, you                                                                       
create a CSS file - let’s call it “custom.css” - containing the
following class:

```css
.table-condensed {
  font-size: 8px;
}
```

Then, to apply it to a *summarytools* object and display it in your browser:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
view(dfSummary(tobacco), custom.css = 'path/to/custom.css', 
     table.classes = 'table-condensed')
```

To display a smaller table that is not **that** smaller, you can use the
provided css class `st-small`.

## Working with _shiny_ apps

To include _summarytools_ functions into _shiny_ apps, it is recommended that you:

 - set `bootstrap.css` to `FALSE` to avoid interacting with the app's layout  
 - adjust the size of the graphs in `dfSummary()`  
 - omit headings  
 
#### Example:

```r
print(dfSummary(somedata, graph.magnif = 0.8), 
      method = 'render',
      headings = FALSE,
      bootstrap.css = FALSE)
```

# Final notes

The package comes with no guarantees. It is a work in progress and
feedback / feature requests are welcome. Just send me an email
(dominic.comtois (at) gmail.com), or open an
[Issue](https://github.com/dcomtois/summarytools/issues) if you find a
bug.

Also, the package grew significantly larger, and maintaining it all by
myself is time consuming. If you would like to contribute, please get in
touch, I’d greatly appreciate the help.
