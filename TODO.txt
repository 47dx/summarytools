# TODO:
# make frequencies more lapply-friendly: can it detect that it was called by lapply? If so:
        # - make the name appear, as opposed to x[[1]], x[[2]], etc.
        # - prevent double displaying (the "silent" return doesn't seem to work unless assignment takes place)
# make frequencies by-friendly and replace dd[x, ] with the actual variable name
